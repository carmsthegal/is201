            <p>Traveling allows me to experience new cultures, meet amazing people, and see breathtaking landscapes. It broadens my perspective and helps me grow as a person. Every journey teaches me something new about the world and myself.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Here are some cool stories that keep me wanting to travel!</p>
            <ul>
            <li>In Edinbourgh, Scotland we met the nicest guy in a Kebab shop and we walked the World Cup together and he bought us dessert and recommended shops for us to visit!</li>
            <br>
            <li>In Spain, we met the best people! Our Bishop Digbuori would always give the kids candy, hugs, and jokes and make everyone feel so special.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In Mexico, we played street soccer with this random group of kids and it ended up being the most fun I've ever had playing soccer and they were all good sports and we all celebrated after anyone scored!</i></li>
            <br>
            <li>In Belgium, me and my cousins rented scooters and rode through the city and ate the most delicious waffles ever!</li>
            <br>
            <li>In Thailand, Olivia and I ate juicy mangos, danced at the markets, and tanned on the beautiful beaches of Thailand. It's an experience I will never forget.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In San Francisco, me and my siblings blasted the song Sugar by Maroon 5 while eating puff cheetos and driving across the Golden Gate Bridge. Earlier that day we went to the Jelly Bean Factory and spent the day under the warm California sun.
            </li>
            </ul>
